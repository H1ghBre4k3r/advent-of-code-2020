# Advent of Code

>**Note:** I decided to not use 25 programming languages, but rather try to get my solutions as short as possible. 

These are my ugly solutions for the programming tasks of [`Advent of Code 2020`](https://adventofcode.com).

Feel free to take this as inspiration, but i cannot guarantee functional correctness, since i try to use another language each day.
